        <p>My work addresses modern western social mores and political trends. The capitalist and industrial structures that surround us inevitably impact our capacities for social interaction and individual human development. Through utilization of readily recognized imagery, such as human body parts and organs, I explore a variety of traditionally human cultural concepts. These concepts include but are not limited to morality, prophecy, communication, perception and understanding, worship, the sacred, and individual identity within the social mass.</p>

<p>My preferred imagery is intentionally provocative and occasionally somewhat distorted and disturbing. Mutilation of human elements provides the essential idea of desecration of self and the organic as well as the violence with which our modern social mechanism operates. The use of decay directly mirrors the simultaneous deterioration of our industrial constructs and our relationships to ourselves, one another, and the organic world. By juxtaposing organic imagery with industrial and artificial media, I call into consideration the growing artifice in our surroundings and therefore ourselves. The organic within us and around us is becoming obsolete, being replaced by the synthetic.</p>

<p>I draw the history and development of human civilization into the dialogue, such as in the prophecy works, to provide contrast to society's perception of and dialogue with the sacred in the past and present. The works relating to worship call western social and economic values into question. The speech and communication series embodies the restrictions on what can or cannot be legally said, what ideas are unacceptable to express in social and political realms and the limitations we place on ourselves and others in basic interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p>My preferred media include fabricated steel and cast iron for their obvious industrial history and connotation, and resins, plastics, and other polymers for their context in modern habitual use. These materials are basic elements in day to day life and comprise the essential backbone of civilization in the modern era. The desired response in the viewer is to question the extensive prevalence of these tools and materials around them and consider the impact of industrialized society on the human and environmental elements that comprise the living attributes of the world around us.</p>

<p>I desire to inspire dialogue with and amongst viewers; to provide the elements for open ideation and candid conversation on a variety of topics that directly affect every human in our culture. My work is a mechanism to expose artifice and reintroduce the organic into interpersonal and social communication structures.</p>

<!-- This page passed validation for HTML5 with 2 warnings -->
<!--  Using experimental feature: HTML5 Conformance Checker.

The validator checked your document with an experimental feature: HTML5 Conformance Checker. This feature has been made available for your convenience, but be aware that it may be unreliable, or not perfectly up to date with the latest development of some cutting-edge technologies. If you find any issues with this feature, please report them. Thank you.

 Using Direct Input mode: UTF-8 character encoding assumed

Unlike the "by URI" and "by File Upload" modes, the "Direct Input" mode of the validator provides validated content in the form of characters pasted or typed in the validator's form field. This will automatically make the data UTF-8, and therefore the validator does not need to determine the character encoding of your document, and will ignore any charset information specified.

If you notice a discrepancy in detected character encoding between the "Direct Input" mode and other validator modes, this is likely to be the reason. It is neither a bug in the validator, nor in your document. -->
